# Project Proposal, Step 2

Your grade will depend upon your ability to clearly respond to the assignment—concepts *and* constraints.

**Assignment:** Submit a written project proposal (~3 pages) and a presentation (3–5 minutes—probably ~5 slides) that

1. Motivates and outlines your ***causal* question** of interest.
2. Explains **potential sources of selection** that could lead to bias.
3. Describes the **ideal experiment** which one could use to answer this question
4. Discusses a **practical research design** through which one could answer the original question—clarifying *how* this research design avoids selection bias.

*Note:* Your question **must be causal in nature**. If it is not, come up with a new question.

**Important:** You do not need to have the data. However, obtaining the data should be feasible.

**Title:** A title that clearly describes your question—and potentially how you would answer it.

**Abstract:** A brief description of your project. Clearly describe the main question, how you will answer it, and why/for whom the results matter. Be concise and clear. You hook the reader here and elaborate later.

The abstract should be less than 150 words. Read a few abstracts before writing your abstract. ([AER](https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/676), [QJE](https://academic.oup.com/qje/issue), [ReSTAT](https://direct.mit.edu/rest), [JAERE](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jaere/current), [JPubE](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-public-economics))

**Question and motivation:**  Explain why this area of research is interesting/important in general (not just to you). Why should your reader care/keep reading? After you  **briefly** motivate the general topic, clearly describe your specific **causal question**. If necessary, motivate the specific question too.

**Selection:**  Why is this question challenging to answer empirically? In other words, what sources of selection bias concern you? If we simply run a regression of y on X, why might the estimated effect be biased?

**Ideal experiment:**  Describe the ideal experiment that would answer your question. This *ideal* experiment does not need to be practical—*i.e.*, you do not need to be able to run it in real life.

**Practical research design:**  How could you *causally* answer the your question in *real life*? Which **data** would you need? What sort of **research design** would you apply—selection on observables (regression with many controls, matching, propensity-score methods, *etc.*) or selection on observables (IV, RD, *etc.*)? How does this proposed research design **avoid selection bias**? Explain clearly and draw a DAG.
